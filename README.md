## Reflection Questions
1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here. 
No,I just did on my own and some of the part just followed the instructions in the project

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words) 
I did typing mistake at 2 places,got to know as the output is not working after the particular change,once i reviewed the code overall again i am able to solve those mistakes.

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
I did a good job,i am able to do almost most of the project,got clues from the description of each step made the work
more easier.
The question is how you going to analyze our skills through this guided clues assignment?,(i feel good at
one point as i can perform with confidence and better with this approach)

How is it going to be in the webdevelopment job roles from lower level to higher level
What are the issues while deveopling webpages/sites that does not have solution till now.

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
I would try new things to develop like,

1)It could be sounding color names when the particular color pressed ,which is general application in children playbooks.
2)It can be modified as a piano player for playing music.
3)It can be a game when a color is pressed, the particular color throws on screeen to make differnt shapes.
4)It can be modified to insert particular color on the image painting.
